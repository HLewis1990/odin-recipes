<br>
<p>Bowser’s Power Flower Curry features a 1-POUND meatball covered in mozzarella cheese sitting on a bed of mushroom marinara sauce and sprinkled with parsley. The face of Bowser stares back from a puff pastry and its served with a side of hot sauce. </p>
<br>
<p>Bowser’s Fireball Challenge is a tasty dish but the steep price might make most people think twice. The meatall is well seasoned and despite it’s large size is well cooked throughout and not dry. The mushroom marinara is zesty and fairy spicy — you’ll break little bit of a sweat with this one. The bright red hot sauce on the side was not particularly good, not because of the heat level but just the general flavor was not particularly good nor did it pair well with the rest of the dish.</p>
